# Addon content
| Directory | Description |
|---|---|
| devops/ | Will be deployed on the control machine, in a path `<path_to_alambic_devops>/<addon_name>`. It may contain the following elements :<ul><li>**env/** : Contains *<environment>.yml* files, named after the inventories (development, productionâ€¦). These variables will be usable as environment variables in custom scripts, as they will automatically be loaded by the alambic playbook `run_addon_script`.</li><li>**roles/** : Contains custom ansible roles which can be used in custom playbooks.</li><li>*<playbook_name>.yml* : Custom playbooks. In order to load the environment variables, the alambic role `load_env_vars` can be loaded. The variables will then be accessible from the playbook in the dictionary `addon_env`.</li><li>*<playbook_script>.sh* : Scripts generally intended to be launched directly from the control machine, to perform complex operations (launch several playbooks with different parameters for example)</li><li>*ansible.cfg* : Allows to use default alambic roles in custom playbooks</li></ul> |
| jobs/ | Will be deployed on the remote host. Contains `jobs.xml` file, describing all the jobs callable through the alambic application (usually via the `run_addon_job` playbook). |
| scripts/ | Will be deployed on the remote host. Contains custom shell scripts, usually called via the `run_addon_script` playbook from alambic application. |
| output/ | Will be deployed on the remote host. This diretory is empty on deployment, results from addon jobs executions will be found here. |
| resources/ | Will be deployed on the remote host. This directory contains resources needed for the jobs or the scripts for example. Among other things we can frequently find freemarker templates here. |


For more details regarding usage of alambic playbooks in order to execute jobs and/or scripts, please refer to the documentation of [Alambic ETL project](https://github.com/AC-Rennes-OpenSource/alambic).
